Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
You're super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees
Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
It's super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees

Baby, baby, baby
Since i felt your charms
Everything is magic when i'm in your arms
Baby, baby, baby
Something in your voice takes me to a far off place
I have no choice

So don't try to break this spell i'm in
Far too deep to break free
Don't try to bring me back to earth
I'm happier when...

Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
You're super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees
Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
It's super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees

Baby, baby, baby
You're full of mystery
I can't help but feel you're true
What if you were me?
Baby, baby, baby
Your eyes they hypnotise
It always takes me by surprise

So don't try to break this spell i'm in
Far too deep to break free
Don't try to bring me back to earth
I'm happier when...

Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
You're super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees
Everything is magical
When you're near, it's magical
It's super natural
I feel your touch, in my trees
