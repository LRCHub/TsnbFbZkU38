God, you know the human vice
Kimberly, you're high
How many laws would you send?
A magical hurricane?
Is it a new hell to climb?
In the jungle, be a man!

And you love the human rise
Kimberly, you're fine
How many blows would you send?
I smoke a rolled hurricane
Is it a new hell to climb?
Oh! Kimberly, be a man!

Give me love, someday
Give me love to go, give me love someday
