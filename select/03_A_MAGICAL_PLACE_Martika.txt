A magical place
Martika:
You slay me
You bring me hope in a world
Full of fear
And you get me off to start
That never stops
Like wild horses on a windy dau
I feel you now
And you're blowing thru me like a melody
Within my heart, so magical
Christopher max:
Lord help me
I've found a one way ticket to ecstasy
I can't turn it down
When all that's left behind me is a pool of tears
Don't let me drown
I'll never find another who can take me there
Where my heart can feel, so magical
Chorus:
Over the sun, beyond the moon
Where all desire lies
Thru time & space
A magical place
I've found within your eyes
Both:
Don't tell me
I know what you're thinking & it's all
O.k. with me
Cuz there's nowhere deeper i could ever feel
I'd wanna be
With body, mind & soul
I give myself to you
Wont'cha set me free? so magical
Chorus
Both:
Pretty soon someday, one day
For always
We're gonna find, we're gonna find out
That one day is today
And we've never wasted our time with love
Chorus
Thru time & space
A magical place
I've found within you
