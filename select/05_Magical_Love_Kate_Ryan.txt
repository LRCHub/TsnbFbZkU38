I think I feel your love tonight
I think I need you
I think I see you

I'm in the dark I'm in the night
I think I'm dreaming
My heart is screaming

I think I feel your love tonight
Can't you hear me
I want you near me

Don't you need my love tonight deep inside
It's all around me I cannot hide
From this feeling I have inside

Is this a miracle Is this a miracle or a magical love I think I feel your love tonight
I think I see you
I think I need you

I'm in the dark I'm in the night
I think I'm dreaming
My heart is screaming

Don't you need my love tonight deep inside
It's all around me I cannot hide
From this feeling I have inside

Don't you need my love tonight deep inside
It's all around me I cannot hide
From this feeling I have inside

Is this a miracle or a magical love
Is this a miracle or a magical love

Is this a miracle or a magical love
Is this a miracle or a magical love
