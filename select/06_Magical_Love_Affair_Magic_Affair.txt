Oh yeah

Life with me could be so fine
Especially when my love for you is on my mind
There are times when I get so depressed
Cause a word from you put love to the test
I wanna love I swear
I want a magical love affair

When I look in your eyes, I see an angel
Singing in the sky
It's got to be true, but the things that you do
You send me flowers everyday and show the love
All it's special way
There's no one to compare in this magic affair

Let me be the one to hold on to
Let me be the one to make dreams come true
Mystical, magical, mystical, magical
I wanna love I swear
I want a magical love affair

We started out just as friend but when we're loving
Till the very end
With the love that we feel Baby, oceans of silk
You give me only the best we have
Truly the best
With the love that we share like a magic affair

Mystical, magical, mystical, magical
I wanna love I swear
I want a magical love affair
