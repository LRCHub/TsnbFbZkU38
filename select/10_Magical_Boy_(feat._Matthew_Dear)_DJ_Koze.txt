Magical, it's magical
It's magical

Magical, it's magical
It's magical

Magical, it's magical
It's magical

I can't reach you anymore
Not with light or touch
Distant notes beyond the door
Sing them out for me to clutch

Your life precedes
Your eyes are wake
Your head and touch
I want to say

Not till it stops
Not till the mad turns green
Not till it rains
Not till the sun has been seen
Not till it stops
Not till you all come back
Not till it stops
Not till it stops

Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone?

Can I run across seas
Till I touch your face
And take you in my arms
And fly

Can we

It's a serious world
I'm a magical boy
You can count on me
For escape

Can we
Can we

Open up and explore
Show me what you need
I can count on you
For escape

Not till it stops
Not till it stops
Not till it stops
Not till it stops

I can't reach you anymore
Not with light or touch
Distant notes beyond the door
Sing them out for me to clutch

Your life precedes
Your eyes are wake
Your head and touch
I want to say

Not till it stops
Not till the mad turns green
Not till it rains
Not till the sun has been seen
Not till it stops
Not till you all come back
Not till it stops
Not till it stops

Can we be alone?
