Baby's got a magic power, she can change the seasons
She's saving up her magic power, for very special reasons
If you drink her potion, you're going to lose your mind
The water from this magic spring, is the best that you can find...

Take a drink of the water, from the magical spring
You'd better believe it, it's a wonderful thing

You'll love her 'til the end of time
You'll need her 'til you die
Maybe you are wondering
So here's the reason why
She holds the key to everything, inside her pretty hands
She doesn't go to sleep at night, she's making evil plans

You can try, but you just can't tell her no
She'll bring you to your knees, and she'll never let you go
Drink from the fountain, where the air is thin
You'd better believe in the magical spring
